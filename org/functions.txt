HOL functions that will be translated to CakeML:

1. The permutation

An implementation is defined in keccak_funScript.sml, in permutation_def.

The specification is defined in keccak_hol.sml, in permutation1600. This is SML-Code.
I will rewrite this in HOL in the file keccakpermutationScript.sml.

These files have been created last summer, so the types don't match the current
model. The type of the permutation in the spec will be:
   ( ('r+'c) word -> ('r+'c) word)
with r = 1151 and c = 448.

The type of the implementation will be whatver represents 1600 bits well enough.

When in doubt, the SML-Code of the specification is correct, because I've validated
it with the official test vectors.

2. The MITB Step-function.

The specification is defined in mitbScript.sml, in MITB_STEP_def. The type of this
function is likely to change in the near future, as the state will probably contain
an additional bool for the state of the button.
